        (GMS) nations including Laos, Burma, China, Cambodia and Vietnam, and has recently declared Chiang Mai as one of
        three ICT (Information and Communication Technology) Cities. The government activities cover the development of
        e-tourism, e-business for handicraft industry, e-commerce, e-government, e-learning, alternative media, game,
        animation, mobile, e-business for SMEs and larger organizations. The city provides modern infrastructure for
        international business investment, because its economy mainly depends on tourism handicraft and software
        businesses. CMU has just established a new college called College of Arts, Media and Technology (CAMT). CAMT
        focuses on human resource development and innovation in ICT for tourism, handicraft and software industries in
        Northern Thailand. CAMT is aiming at offering undergraduate programs in software engineering, animation,
        e-tourism and handicraft design. At a post-graduate level, CAMT grants degrees for both Master’s and Doctoral
        studies for experienced knowledge workers. Research groups are set up in the college to support industrial
        research.
